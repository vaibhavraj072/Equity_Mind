## 📌 Problem Statement

Finance and strategy teams spend significant time manually analyzing:

- Financial statements  
- Earnings call transcripts  
- Annual reports  
- Market data  
- Peer comparisons  

Challenges include:

- Data scattered across multiple sources  
- Time-consuming manual synthesis  
- Lack of structured justification  
- Limited transparency in decision-making  
- Difficulty comparing companies objectively  

There is a need for an AI agent that does more than summarize —  
it must analyze, compare, justify, and reason like a financial analyst.
