## 🌟 Challenge Overview

**EquityMind AI** is built to solve **Challenge 3: Financial & Market Research Agent** — a problem that requires designing a deep research AI system to support finance, investment, and strategy teams by automatically synthesizing financial reports, earnings calls, market data, and regulatory filings into structured, justifiable insights.

Unlike typical chatbots, this agent must behave like a **junior equity analyst or strategy consultant**, providing explainable, traceable, and confidence-weighted research outputs based on high-quality data synthesis and multi-step reasoning.

---

## 🧠 Core Problem Description

Financial research teams face significant challenges:

- Financial data is **scattered across multiple sources**  
- Manual research is **time-consuming** and error-prone  
- Decision support often lacks **structured reasoning and transparency**  
- Insights must be **traceable and evidence-based**  
- User preferences (e.g., risk tolerance, KPIs) are not consistently integrated  

EquityMind AI addresses these gaps by delivering decision-ready analytical outputs with explicit assumptions, source validation, and confidence scoring — not just cursory summaries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives & Capabilities

### 🔹 Dual Research Modes

**Quick Mode (≤ 2 min)**  
Designed for rapid extraction and summarization:
- Summarize last quarter earnings
- Highlight key risks in annual reports
- Provide revenue growth YoY
- Extract key financial metrics

**Deep Mode (≤ 10 min)**  
Designed for rigorous analysis:
- Full fundamental financial analysis
- Peer benchmarking across similar companies
- Bull vs Bear thesis generation
- Scenario and sensitivity analysis

---

## 📊 Financial Memory

EquityMind AI persists and uses user preferences:
- Risk tolerance (conservative vs aggressive)
- Preferred KPIs (EBITDA, ROE, FCF, etc.)
- Sectors and geographies of interest

This allows personalized recommendations and adaptive follow-up analysis based on user context.

## 🔄 Interactive Analysis Flow

The system is **interactive and iterative**. It:
1. Receives a research query  
2. Asks clarifying questions (e.g., assumptions, time horizon)  
3. Retrieves structured data and narratives  
4. Performs multi-step reasoning  
5. Generates **structured investment memos**  
6. Provides confidence-weighted output with clear assumptions

---

## 📈 Structured Outputs

The agent produces professional analytical outputs, such as:

1. Business overview  
2. Financial performance & trends  
3. Peer benchmarking tables  
4. Bull case thesis  
5. Bear case thesis  
6. Key risks & contradictions  
7. Scenario analysis outcomes  
8. Confidence score & supporting evidence  

These outputs help stakeholders make better decisions — quickly, clearly, and with traceability.

## 🧪 Example Queries

- “Compare Company A vs Company B on fundamentals”  
- “Generate a bull and bear case with evidence”  
- “Highlight risks that are often overlooked”  
- “Stress test assuming higher inflation”  
- “Re-evaluate assuming lower growth”  
- “Based on my preferences, what should I analyze next?”

---

## 🧠 Why EquityMind AI?

EquityMind AI is not a generic chatbot. It is a **domain-specific reasoning system** that:

- Synthesizes data from multiple structured and unstructured sources  
- Produces multi-step analytical reasoning  
- Detects contradictions and inconsistencies  
- Outputs evidence-backed, confidence-weighted conclusions  
- Adapts research based on user profile and preferences

This aligns perfectly with the goals of the official **Financial & Market Research Agent challenge**.
